ProBoard v2.20.00
-----------------

* ProBoard now has a new registration scheme.  It no longer uses the 
  REGKEY.PB file to store your registration information.  Now, your
  registration information is burned into the PROBOARD.EXE file itself.
  I know there are going to be a lot of people out there who won't like
  this change in the slightest, but it's really for new customers of
  ProBoard.  With ProBoard v2.2, new customers don't automatically get
  an unlimited node license when they buy a copy.  They purchase the
  number of nodes they want to run.  The key is the serial number and
  the activation code which is used to unlock the software.  This
  information tells ProBoard how many nodes it will allow.  Now, for all
  those people who already own existing copies of ProBoard, you will
  automatically be upgraded to an unlimited node license as part of your
  upgrade.

  How do I upgrade to v2.2, and get it registered?  It's a four-step
  process.

  Step 1: Download ProBoard v2.2 (which you've already done, or you
          wouldn't be seeing this file).

  Step 2: Run the program included with ProBoard 2.2 called REGINFO.EXE.
          This will read your REGKEY.PB file, and extract out the old
          registration information.  It will then display an eight-digit
          code on the screen which is your Upgrade-ID code.  This code
          will be crucial in the next step.

  Step 3: Visit the TeleGrafix Web site at http://www.telegrafix.com,
          and purchase your upgrade.  While you're filling out the
          upgrade form, you'll be asked for your Upgrade-ID code, the
          name of the SysOp and the BBS name as they appear in ProCFG.
          The Web site will compare this information against the data
          encoded in your Upgrade-ID code, and if they match, you'll 
          automatically be given your new registration information.

          NOTE: A single BBS can only be upgraded once, to prevent pirates
                from stealing your registration information!

  Step 4: Run the REGISTER.EXE program, and key-in the newly assigned
          serial number and activation code.

  That's all there is to it.  You're ready to go online with a fully
  functioning ProBoard system.

* New look and feel for the main console.
  
* Fixed a minor centering problem in the "last caller" field.
  
* Added a new option to the status bar (ALT-J) to "Jump to DOS".  This
  option was already available in the software, but it wasn't documented
  on the main console screen.
  
* Added five new functions to the ProBoard PEX SDK:
  
       fileno()
       getcurdir()
       getdisk()
       _dos_getftime()
       _dos_setftime()

* Changed message 361 in the language files to make room for the expanded
  year string.

* Updated ProCFG.EXE to properly handle four-byte year data entry.  The
  expiration date can be set to "00/00/0000" to indicate no expiration
  date.

* The new user signup now allows you to select from the updated date
  formats:

     MM/DD/YYYY
     YYYY/MM/DD
     DD/MM/YYYY

* The new user signup now forces you to enter four-digit years when asked
  to enter your date of birth.

* The file system now forces you to enter four-digit years when entering a
  date to search for files by.

* Fixed a potentially serious bug with the birthdate asking code.  There
  were circumstances when it might generate a garbled birthdate.

* Added a new macro code to ".A?? File Control Codes".  The new code is
  "^F;" (i.e., 06-59).  This code displays the user's password, or if the
  "Hide Password" option is enabled in ProCFG, then this option will display
  the password hiding character as defined in ProCFG.  
  
* The default SETUP.* menu files have been changed to use the new "^F;" 
  macro code instead of "^FC" for the password display to properly support
  the Hide Password option.

* Changed the look and feel of the SysOp functions F1 and Shift-F1 to be
  more consistent with the main console appearance.

* Changed the color of the status line displayed on the main console when
  a user is logged in.  The new color is more like the main console.

* Changed the entire look and feel of ProCFG to be more similar to the BBS
  main console.

* Fixed a bug with ProCFG where if you make changes to the system
  configuration data, the inappropriate action was taken when you chose to
  save or cancel the changes when you exit.  I don't know if this was
  present in the release version of v2.16, but in the code obtained from
  the author, the exact opposite operation was performed.  If you decided 
  to abandon the changes, they got saved instead, and vice-versa.

* Updated the PB_SDK header, and the library.  Several of the data 
  structures in PB_SDK.H have been updated to be accurate with regard to
  ProBoard v2.2 compatibility.  The .LIB file has also been rebuilt to
  be v2.2 compliant.
